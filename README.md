# PDF Receipt Generator

This project uses Python's `reportlab` library to create a styled PDF receipt. The script generates a sample receipt with subscription data, totals, and discounts displayed in a table format.

## Features
- Customizable table with data entries for date, item name, subscription duration, and price.
- Applies table styling such as grid lines, background color, and text alignment for better readability.
- Automatically saves the generated receipt as `receipt.pdf`.

## Usage
1. Install the `reportlab` library if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install reportlab
